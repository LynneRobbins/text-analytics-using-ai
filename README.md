## Introduction

Text analytics involves converting unstructured text data into meaningful insights. By leveraging ML and AI, we can perform tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, text classification, and more. This project provides a comprehensive toolkit for text analytics, complete with pre-processing utilities, various ML models, and detailed examples.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, lemmatization, stopword removal, etc.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Determine the sentiment of a given text (positive, negative, neutral).
- **Topic Modeling:** Discover abstract topics within a collection of documents.
- **Text Classification:** Classify text into predefined categories.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Identify and categorize key entities in text.
- **Word Embeddings:** Generate vector representations of words using models like Word2Vec, GloVe, and BERT.
